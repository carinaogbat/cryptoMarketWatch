# Welcome to the Crypto Market Watch
The Crypto Market watch is my current project. It
is a simple web application that will connect to a crypto API, 
allowing users to view current crypto prices. Users will also have 
the option of creating an account, allowing them to create a watch list
of their favorite cryptocurrencies.
