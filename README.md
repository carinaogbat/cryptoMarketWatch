# Welcome to the Crypto Market Watch
The Crypto Market watch is my current project (started 09/25/23). It is a simple
React single page web application that will connect to a crypto API, allowing
users to view current crypto prices. Users will also have the option of creating
an account, allowing them to create a watch list of their favorite cryptocurrencies.
